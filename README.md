Steps to run:<br/> 	
	• Upload the Split Image Data to the drive from the link above.<br/>
 	• Run all the cells<br/>
  	• The project will save the .h5 and .pkl files to the directory of the dataset.<br/>
  	• Utilize the saved models to predict for future instances.<br/>
  	• The prediction and accuracy visualizations are inbuilt in the code.<br/>
  	• The project performs comparatitive study of the models and their respective metrics as well.<br/>
  	• Once all cells are run successfully, the project is culminated. <br/>
  	• That's it! Thank you
