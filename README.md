Steps to run: 	
	• Upload the Image Data Link to the drive from the link above.
  • Run all the cells
  • The project will save the .h5 and .pkl files to the directory of the dataset.
  • Utilize the saved models to predict for future instances.
  • The prediction and accuracy visualizations are inbuilt in the code.
  • The project performs comparatitive study of the models and their respective metrics as well.
  • Once all cells are run successfully, the project is culminated. 
  • That's it! Thank you
